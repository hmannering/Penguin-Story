Then he went and collected them and handed the dog an egg. The dog handed the penguin some carrots and said, "Thanks for the egg." The penguin said, "No problem"  then quickly took off. <img src= "http://cdn.petplace.com/images/default-source/Featured-Wide-Large/4567_dogs.jpg?sfvrsn=3" style="width:25%" Later the dog tried to eat the egg and realized it was a rock. </p>
